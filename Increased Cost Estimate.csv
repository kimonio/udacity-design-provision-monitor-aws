Rationale:
With the additional budget, adding the following to improve redundancy and performance:
- Enabled Multi-AZ deployment for the Amazon RDS for MySQL to provide near zero RTO/RPO issues when failing over from one AZ to another.
- Setup Multi-site deployment in another region to provide the best RTO/RPO in the event of a region wide failure in the primary region.
- Multi-site deployment also allows traffic to be load balanced across the two regions providing increased capacity for handling any additional traffic load, as well as improved performance by using Route53 latency based routing and ensuring customers traffic are routed to the closest region.
