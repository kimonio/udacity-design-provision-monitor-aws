Rationale:
Reduced the cost below $6500 per month by doing the following:
- Enabled standard reserved instances for 1 year for Amazon RDS for MySQL, resulting in cost savings over using on-demand instances.
- Enabled standard reserved instances for 1 year for Amazon EC2, resulting in cost savings over using on-demand instances.
- Reduced the total number of EC2 instances from 16 to 8 which sets up 2 webservers in each availability zone as well as 2 application servers in each availability zone.
- With autoscaling enabled for both the web and application tiers, additional EC2 instances can be spun up to deal with any increased load that may exceed the existing setup.
